       <p>Intuitively, parks and preserved lands have a positive effect on the environment. What could be more "environmentally-friendly" or "green" than preserving parkland and open space? Benefits like improved water quality and air quality, increases in biodiversity and habitat protection, and reductions in greenhouse gases (GHG), are all inherent in a strategy that protects and preserves land. However, the specifics of these environmental benefits, and the mechanisms behind them, are often less obvious. Furthermore, environmental benefits are often difficult to quantify and may not receive as much consideration as those which are easily quantifiable. This section attempts to identify and describe these key environmental effects, as well as the potential drawbacks or challenges of preserving parks and open lands region-wide. 
        Benefits:
        Reduce Climate change
        Improve air quality
        Helps in  biodiversity
         Improve water quality
