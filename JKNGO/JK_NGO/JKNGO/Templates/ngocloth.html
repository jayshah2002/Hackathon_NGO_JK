       <p>When you donate your clothes, you are saving the environment from a lot of harm. According to the EPA, it costs $45 on average per ton to dispose of waste in a landfill. Clothing that sits in landfill releases toxic greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the environment when they break down. Lastly, making new clothes takes hundreds of gallons of water, and the production of new textiles accounts for 10% of all carbon emissions on the planet. All of these things can be avoided if you donate your clothes for reuse.
        Even though you don’t want your old clothes anymore, it’s almost guaranteed that someone else will. There are many people in need of usable clothing. There are disaster victims, underprivileged people, and children in need of clothing, and your donations can help. When you throw away your clothes, they have no chance of reaching people who need them the most. 
        We all do what we can do to reduce waste and pollution, such as walking instead of driving, and clothing donation is another option. Clothing donation helps the environment in more ways than one. When people buy used clothes rather than new ones, fewer new clothes need to be made. Producing new clothing puts out a lot of greenhouse gases, so when you stick to used clothes, you’re doing your part to reduce those gases
        Donating clothes is actually a really simple process. With all the various clothing donation stores out there, it doesn’t have to be viewed as a burden at all. Plus, just think about all the people that you’re helping during the process. Stores like Goodwill, Salvation Army, and many other local consignment stores and shelters make it a super simple process to donate used clothing. There are so many benefits of reusing clothes or donating clothes to the homeless that it really makes sense when you stop and think about it.
        If you have a pile of clothes that you’re never going to use, consider charitable donations for donating your clothes as they should be at the top of your list.
